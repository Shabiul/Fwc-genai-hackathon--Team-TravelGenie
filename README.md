## End-to-End Documentation: How to Run the TravelGenie Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local system:

1. **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)  
   Download and install from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Git**  
   Install Git by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
3. **Text Editor** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)  
   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended.

### Steps to Run the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumithsigtia/Fwc-genai-hackathon--Team-TravelGenie.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning, navigate into the project directory using the terminal:

```bash
cd Fwc-genai-hackathon--Team-TravelGenie
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

The project uses **Next.js** and other dependencies that are managed by **npm**. To install all necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required Node.js packages as defined in the `package.json` file.

#### 4. Set Up Environment Variables (if required)

If the project relies on any environment variables (e.g., API keys), make sure to set them up.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project directory.
2. Add necessary environment variables in this file NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your gemini api key and NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your unsplash api key.

#### 5. Run the Development Server

Once everything is set up, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application locally on `http://localhost:3000`. You can open this URL in your browser to access the app.

#### 6. Explore the Application

Now you can explore the **TravelGenie** app and see how it dynamically generates personalized travel itineraries using Generative AI.

#### 7. Building the Project for Production (Optional)

If you want to build the project for production, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command optimizes the project for deployment.
